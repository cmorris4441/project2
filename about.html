     <p>Hello, My Name is Cameron Morris. I aspire to be a computer engineer and have started my journey at OCC. This semester has been extremely challenging for me, working a full-time job, enrolled in school full time taking 4 classes all while raising a toddler. Most days it feels as though I may have brought on more than I can handle but it is also inspiring and instils the values that will lead to success. I decided to enroll in school to get a better and more flexible line of work, being a computer engineer will allow me to work from home in most cases which will be a great help in raising my son Saint. Additional to work and school I exercise quite a bit, 7 days a week for 1.5-2 hours a day, in the beginning it was something difficult to add into my life but as time has gone on, it is something I look forward to. I am 26 years old and this is the second time I've been in college the 1st was right after Highschool I attended MSU and my degree focus was Human Biology, while I did good in school after 2.5 years I decided to drop out because of a few reason but most of all because I never felt like school was for me. So I got a job and saved money for a while and after about 4 years I opened a smoke shop with a couple of friends. It was decently successful but very time consuming, I was the owner-operator of the smoke shop for sometime and after 3 years I decided to close. After the closing of the store I had many months of feeling like life was over at the ripe age of 25, but talking to family and friends I found some interest in computer engineering which has brought me to this point.
