	<h3> HTML 5 Programming</h3>
	<p>Class instructor is Hadi Nasser, HTML5 is defined as the fifth version of HTML, a markup language used by web browsers to visualize code. It features several improvements in website capabilities, web content development, and more. This exact project I've restarted at least 12 times and I still feel self conscious about the assignment, but I showed my mom today and she said it was nice so that made me feel a lot better!

	<h3> Composition 1</h3>
	<p>Class instructor is Megan Bush, covers basic concepts and skills for students to study how to read and write at the college level. College English composition is usually taken in the first semester of a college degree program. Students learn how to analyze, summarize, and evaluate written works. This course is pretty rigorous 1-2 papers due a week has definitely helped me on my writing skills.

	<h3> Networking Concepts</h3>
	<p>Class instructor is Bernadette Mcallister, goes over the interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies. Moving into the engineering world knowing the interconnections of a network is important, all of the projects for this course are very intriguing, she has us make sales pitches! I think this is a great way to learn.

	<p>Class instructor is Dr. Redwhan, introduction to the design and organization of database management systems. Topics include the relational data model, relational algebra, SQL query language, database software development, data security, normalization, client/server environments. Very, very difficult course, he structured it well and guides us through but the project manager world is tough and this prepares us for it.
